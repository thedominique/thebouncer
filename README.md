Me and Caroinle-A wrote this in an attempt to understand semaphores. As you might know (probably not) we are great fans of metaphores. Almost to the extent that it has become a problem. But we don't talk about that. Please don't judge our coding abilities. We have only just begun our journey to achieve C programming God status. 

Thank you and may you have a nice coffee this life time.
